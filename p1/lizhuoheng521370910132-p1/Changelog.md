## Milestone 1
### released date : 2021-9-30
1.Completed the drawing of the cross road


2.Completed the drawing and change of the traffic light


3.Preliminarily generated the cars



### Bugs:
1.The traffic light change has delays

## Milestone 2
### released date : 2021-10-8
1.Cars can move according to the traffic light


2.Generate car plates in permutations


3.Generate the matrix of the possibility that a car jumps the red light or turn left/right


4.Improve the drawing of the cross road



### Bugs:
1.Car crash is not considered


2.Cars do not vanish after crossing the road and move on forever

## Milestone 3
### released date : 2021-10-15
1.Car crash is recorded and the details are reported


2.It is now possible for cars to jump the red light


3.Allow the player to choose a difficulty level and automatically adjust all the parameters accordingly


4.Design more realistic cars of various sizes


5.Function removed : gencars and mov (Integerated into the main program)



### Bugs
1.When a crash happens, there would be several **same** warnings.


2.The function *pause* is applied to simulate the flow of time. However, there are other commands besides pause. So the actual running time (which also varies considerably among different computers) may be larger than the expected time.
