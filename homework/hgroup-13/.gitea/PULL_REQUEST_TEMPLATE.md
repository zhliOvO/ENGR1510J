- [ ] well structured (e.g. functions, organisation, algorithm)
- [ ] not redundant (e.g. no copy/paste)
- [ ] easy to read (e.g. comments, indentation, variable names are clear)
- [ ] space effective (e.g. number of variables, size of the memory used)
- [ ] checking the validity of the inputs (e.g. validate input before running)
- [ ] easy and clear to the user (e.g. clear prompt, instructions)
