EX1:
    A README file is a discriptive file that offers a details about a project.
    A README file should contain:
        the name, usage and special features of the project;
        how to use the project( how to get started, get help );
        who maintains and contributes to the project;
        credits and licences;
	reference: github docs about READMEs
EX2:
    do a number of operations with the given matrices x,y
EX3:
    input a vector of 1000 durations between 60 to 12345987 seconds
    e.g.66,145,4636,134213...
    output a vector of the given input converted to days
EX4:
    input a distance e.g.1230
    output how many laps finished and how far to finish another lap
    

EX5:
    The Eratosthenes's method:
        He found that at noon, the sun shone directly down a deep vertical well in 
        Syene, a town 500 miles away from his hometown Alexandria where the sun 
        didn't shine directly. And he calculated the angle between the sunlight and 
        the vertical direction in Alexandria by measuring the tangent:the length of 
        the shadow of a vertical stick there divided by stick length at noon. The 
        angle equals to the angular difference between the verticals at Syene and 
        Alexandria.With the distance between the 2 towns known, the radius and the 
        circumference of the earth could be known.
    simple algorithm:
        1.figure out the angle between the sunlight and 
        the vertical direction in a spot by measuring the tangent
        2. figure out  the distance between the spot and where the sun shines 
        directly.
        3. compute the circumference using the angle and the distance

Ex6:
    input a list of values and input the required convertion type
         e.g. [140,24,35] 
              stones to pounds
    output a list of values converted to the required type
Ex7:
    display the number of primes between 1 and 100000.
    display  5 random numbers between 1 to 10.
