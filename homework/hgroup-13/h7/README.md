## Ex1

- ### Introduction

  ​	The programme prompts the user for the current year, the user’s current age, and another year and it calculates the age that the user was or will be in the second year entered.

- ### Input

  ​	three lines, the current year on the first, the current age on the second, and the other year on the third.

- ### Output

  ​	one line showing the calculated age

## Ex2

- ### Introduction

  ​	The programme displays a menu for the user to choose between converting US dollars into Chinese RMB and Chinese RMB into US dollars. The user inputs the amount and the precision, then the program display the corresponding result. Note: use 1.00 USD = 6.20350 CNY as the exchange rate

- ### Input

  ​	three lines, the first one being 1 for USD or 2 for CNY, the amount on the second one, and the precision on the third one;

  ​	Precision means “how many digit are expected in the final result”, e.g. 123.456 has precision 6

- ### Output

  ​	one line showing the result of the conversion

## Ex3

- ### Input 

  ​	two matrices A and B from a text file called matrices.txt

- ### Output

  ​	A + B, A · B and A T · B T ( T: transpose ) in a text file named result.txt

## Ex4

- ### Introduction

  ​	function 1 prompts the user for a and determines N such that uN = 1. 2. 

  ​	function 2 prompts the user for a value M, and returns A, where A is the value a, in the range 2 – M, for which N is maximize

- ### Input

  ​	Input: two lines, the first one being 1 or 2 for the function from question 1 or 2, respectively, and an integer corresponding to a or M on the second one;

- ### Output

  ​	one line showing the result;

## Ex5
